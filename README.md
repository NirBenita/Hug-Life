# Hug-tivate
Building a vest that lights up when you hug.

A barometric sensor monitors the air pressure in two IV bags. The IV bags are placed on your chest, and will be squeezed whenever you’re hugged — this  will cause a flux in air pressure inside our bags.

Using an Arduino, we’re able to pass that value to an array of LEDs, which lets our vest “react” to the gesture..
